# Room Booking Website
 
I built this website for Web322 at Seneca College. The assignment was to create an AirBnB clone using express and handlebars.

It uses the following:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Express
* Handlebars

# Functionality
This website allows users to book rooms that are available to rent. It was built for an assignment at Seneca College, so the funcionality is limited. Users can vew available rooms by location. There is a functional log-in using javascript validation, bcrypt, and express sessions. Room data is retrieved from MongoDB and displayed onscreen with the use of handlebars templates. Upon logging in, users are able to view their dashboard which will display another search and featured listings. Users with administrative privileges are able to create, delete, and edit listings.
